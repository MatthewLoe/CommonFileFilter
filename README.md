# CommonFileFilter
Author: Matthew Loe

Filters for common files between two directories.
Also contains code for copying the contents of one directory to another 
specified location.

Currently requires user to hardcode the compared directories and the name
(location) of the dicrectory for files found to be in common.
Also currently fails if the target directory already exists as the code will
create a new directory on each run.
